# Pantheon Connect

A little about the contents of this repository:
- `MixedRealityTest` contains the source code for the Unity project. Note that due to Oculus integration taking up around 1 GB of space and Unity-generated compiled files taking up around 6 additional GB, they have been removed from the project. You can also directly compile the .apk file to a Quest device to directly run the program.
- `PantheonConnect` contains the source code for the website and server—to launch the website, you can crete a python virtual environment inside the `server` subdirectory, activate it, and run `$ node .`

The website contains the JQuery and GSAP min files—aside from that, all code was written by Team Pantheon.
All Unity elements in scene + *used* scripts with the exception of the aesthetic environment was wwritten by Team Pantheon.
